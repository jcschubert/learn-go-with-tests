# Creating a first Program

* make a directory under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/{your-user-id}/hello`.
* you can put `hello` in a subfolder, e.g. `learn-go-with-tests`.
* Note: For each chapter, make a new folder and choose an appropritate name.
* Note: Github seems to be mandatory in the go world.
* The VSCode Go Extension might suggest missing go commands to install. Do so.
* Create a `hello.go` in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/{your-user-id/learn-go-with-tests/hello`} and re-create the first example from [here](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world).
  * `package` declaration
  * `import` statement for the `fmt` package
  * declaration of a mandatory `main` function
  * Noteworthy Syntax: No semicolons! Exported method names start with a capital letter!
